       <alt> <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.
    Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than
   a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most
    occur in mountain ranges. </p></alt>
